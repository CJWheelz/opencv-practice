# OpenCV Practice Code

### This project is a series of files, organized by chapter from an online course I took to learn openCV with C++.

**NOTE**: You can ignore the entire `opencv-practice.xcodeproj` directory as it is just project settings/metada. The files are all within the `opencv-practice` directory.
